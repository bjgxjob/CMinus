C-Minus Compiler,Assembler,VM & GUI
I write this software to help me understand the hood of compiler.
1. How the code is converted to assembly language
2. How the assembly language is converted to machine code
3. How the machine code is executed in the machine.
The gui project is a demo IDE for demonstrating the idea of pipe architecture. I also use it to test all core components.
